# qlora-llama2

LLAMA-2 7B trained on kaist-ai/CoT-Collection using QLORA. The Dataset is available on HuggingFace.

Conclusions based on my limited testing so far:
The 7B model performs adequately on extractive question answering. However, it does not do so well in reasoning tasks. Perhaps a larger model or better prompting would help.
